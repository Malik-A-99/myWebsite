    My name is Malik Alimohamed. I am passionate about computers and software development. I have studied at Douglas College, SFU and attended the Canadian Forces Leadership and Recruit School.

    I have studied computing studies and information systems at Douglas College, and have studied Data Science at Simon Fraser University.
    <br>
    I am hard working, able to perform under stress, have time management skills, have a good understanding of computer hardware and software, and I am always motivated. I don't give up or back down from a challenege.

    Comments from my instructors in the military: 
    <p>"They exhibited excellent behaviour consistent with the core values upheld by the CAF ethos, while also demonstrating an understanding of their role in ensuring their actions and standards positively reflect those of the CAF. They displayed excellent knowledge of stress management and resilience techniques, effectively employing them promptly to overcome all challenges encountered in the military training environment, whether in garrison or field operations.</p>
    <br>During the course, they demonstrated very good teamwork within the section and platoon. They displayed good military comportment."
